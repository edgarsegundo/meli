By default, Angular Material doesn’t apply global CSS. Meaning that a standard element (eg. <h1>) will not have Angular materials' styles applied to it. So, when configured this way, in order to apply Angular material styles to a broad section of your HTML, you can use the mat-typography class

<h1>This header doesn't have Angular Material styling</h1>
<section class="mat-typography">
<h1>This header does have Angular Material styling</h1>
</section>


ng generate @angular/material:navigation nav
ng generate component items
ng g s shared/items
